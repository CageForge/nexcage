  # Note: OCI specs, crun, and Proxmox VE are monitored via
  # .github/workflows/dependency_check.yml workflow
  # Dependabot doesn't support direct monitoring of:
  # - OCI Runtime/Image Specs (specifications, not packages)
  # - crun library (C library, typically via git submodule)
  # - Proxmox VE releases (external system, not a package)
