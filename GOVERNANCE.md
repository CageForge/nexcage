# Governance

Decision-making follows a lightweight maintainer model:

- Day-to-day: Maintainers decide within their ownership areas
- Architectural: Require ADR, discussion on PR, and 2-LGTM
- Releases: Primary Maintainer approves tags and release notes
- Disputes: Resolved via ADR plus majority of maintainers
